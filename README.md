The ENCODE Encyclopedia comprises two levels of epigenomic and transcriptomic annotations (Figure 1). The ground level includes annotations such as peaks and quantifications for individual data types produced by the ENCODE uniform processing pipelines. The integrative level contains annotations generated by integrating multiple ground-level annotations. The core of the integrative level is the Registry of candidate cis-Regulatory Elements (cCREs) which are displayed in SCREEN, a web-based visualization engine designed specifically for the Registry. SCREEN allows the user to explore cCREs and investigate how these elements relate to other Encyclopedia annotations and raw ENCODE data.

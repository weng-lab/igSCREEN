To Do:
1. Fine Tuning Code Pipeline set up to train
2. Refine Rag pipeline 

A possible question is "Provide me a link of 51-1000 region for ch17 for brca1" --> Something like this

Sample Questions:

1. What cCREs are annotated in chr15:43796142-43804574?
2. List cCREs found between 34179005 and 34252523 on chromosome 9. --> Double check
3. Are any cCREs present in the genomic interval chr8:85220587-85284073?
4. Could you check for any cCREs within chr3 196867856 196934714? --> Double check
5. Find all candidate cis-regulatory elements in chrX:134460165-134520513.
6. What enhancers regulate SPIB in B cells?
7. Where is SPIB expressed?
8. Can you redirect me to chr12 for 1234 to 12345?

Right now you’ve got two deterministic look-ups:

ensure_best_region → single /region/... URL

ensure_best_gene → single /gene/... URL

But as your site grows you’ll also want to power more conversational, open-ended queries like:

“What enhancers regulate SPIB in B cells?”
→ FAISS-retrieve the top k cCRE docs for SPIB and ask your LLM to summarize and inject the /gene/SPIB/icres link.

“Show me the blood‐cell eQTL variants for TP53.”
→ FAISS-retrieve the top variant docs for TP53 and have LLM answer:
“Here’s the Variant Portal for TP53: … You can further filter by eQTL significance…”

“What phenotypes are associated with NOD2?”
→ In the future you’ll add a Phenotype FAISS index; RAG will retrieve the relevant phenotype‐gene links, then LLM will produce a natural-language summary.

“How do I find distal enhancers on the portal?”
→ You might add a small UI-instructions index or few-shot UI template. FAISS gives you the right doc (“interaction.3”), LLM formats it as “1. Click ‘Filters’… 2. Select ‘Distal’…”

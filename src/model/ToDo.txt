For future whoever will be working on:

1. Create a virtual environment
2. pip install all the requirements in requirements.text
3. Run rag_setup.py before running rag_pipeline.py
4. Have fun. 


What is left:
1. Choose the Approach to Pursue
2. Refine the Model
    (RAG) Create FAISS Index for Variants
    (Fine Tuning) Gather More Prompts and Enhance the Model
    (Hybrid) Implement it
3. Successfully Deploy the Model
4. Refine the Model Based on User Feedback
5. Good luck
